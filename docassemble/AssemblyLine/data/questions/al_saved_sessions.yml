  This feature is designed to help people who work on multiple forms that have
  shared questions, such as names, addresses, and information about 
  family members.
  </p>
  <p>
  You will only be able to copy some of your answers:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Copying answers depends on the way each form was designed. The author may
    not have written both forms in a way that is compatible with this feature.
    </li>
    <li>Images, file uploads, and signatures are never copied by this feature. You
    will need to sign the document again and upload any exhibits again.
    </li>
    </ul>
  <p>    
  It may not be possible to edit some answers:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>
  Editing depends on features in each form. Some forms may not have edit
    features that cover all of your answers.
  </li>
  </ul>
