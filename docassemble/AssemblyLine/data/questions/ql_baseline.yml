comment: |
  This is left as just object_name() rather than "address of object_name()" because
  commonly the word "address" would be included in the variable name.

  You should generally consider overriding this question with one that will be easier
  to read. This is here just as a placeholder. It will be difficult to translate and
  the variable name will not always make sense to show the user even with the help
  of object_name().
