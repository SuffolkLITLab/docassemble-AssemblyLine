comment: |
  This is left as just object_name() rather than "address of object_name()" because
  commonly the word "address" would be included in the variable name.

  You should generally consider overriding this question with one that will be easier
  to read. This is here just as a placeholder. It will be difficult to translate and
  the variable name will not always make sense to show the user even with the help
  of object_name().

  Special instructions for the cover page
subquestion: |
  Before we deliver your form, you can include instructions on the cover
  page that will be sent to the clerk at ${trial_court}.
  
  For example, you may have special instructions about how and when to reach
  you that you did not already include in the contact information section.
  
  The clerk _may_ print the cover page and include it in the public file.

  Are there any instructions that you would like to give to the clerk that will
  receive your forms?

  What to include?
content: |
  Include information that you want the clerk to know. The clerk is the person
  who will receive your paperwork and put it in an official court file. The
  clerk is not a decision maker on your case.

  Do not include information that is meant for the judge or the other party.
  Do not include information that is meant to be part of your official case.

  There is a chance this information may end up in the public court file, so
  do not include sensitive or private information.

  This question is asked if the interview can be used by both
  a Plaintiff and a Defendant. It sets the value of `user_role`, `user_started_case`,

  used by the Plaintiff or Defendant, set `user_ask_role = 'plaintiff'` or
  `user_ask_role='defendant'` in your code.
