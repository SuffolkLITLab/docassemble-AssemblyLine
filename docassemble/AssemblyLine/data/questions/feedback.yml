  Tester feedback form
decoration: opinion  
subquestion: |
  This form is designed to be used by testers and community
  stakeholders. 
  
  The information you type here will be publicly available. That means anyone
  will be able to see it. 
  
  It helps us to know how to prioritize your feedback. We use
  a [5-level 
  rating](https://suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/docs/legal-tech-overview/maturity-model/#example-maturity-model-for-the-massaccess-project)
  for our finished forms. Forms are usually 
  ready to publish when they meet level 1, but all kinds of
  feedback are valuable. Some forms will reach level 2-5 through 
  iterative revision. Some will stay at level 1. Categorizing feedback
  helps us choose the right tasks to work on in the right order.
  
  #### Description of levels
  1. A user is able to correctly fill in the full form, like the paper form.
      * 1.5 Eliminates compound question. First pass at plain language.
  2. Similar to an intake with a new attorney
  3. Similar to an intake with an experienced attorney
  4. Provides substantial help and tailored resources in addition
  to filling in the form.

variable name: maturity_levels
data:
  - Level 1 - this needs to be fixed to be equivalent to the blank form
  - Level 1.5 - it works as-is, but this is a significant plain language issue
  - Level 2 - this needs to be fixed to meet expectations of a basic intake
  - Level 3 - this needs to be fixed to meet expectations of a sophisticated intake worker
  - Level 4 - this is purely an enhancement to improve user experience
