  This placeholder is used in the intro screen.
  
  In general, the title should follow the format
  "Ask the court for..." or "Respond to a ..." with a short, plain language
  description of what using the interview will accomplish.

  interview_short_title = "[PLACEHOLDER: Ask the court for a ...]"

code: |

  # Check if the title was an actual text entry, or None
  if metadata_title:
    interview_short_title = "Ask the court for a " + metadata_title
  else:
    # This branch will happen for Docx where the interview_metadata dictionary
    # was never defined.
